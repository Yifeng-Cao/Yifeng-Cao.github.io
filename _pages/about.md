I am a Master's student in Electronic Engineering at Columbia University, focusing on robotics, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. I have had the privilege of being advised by Professor Matei Ciocarlie at the Robotic Manipulation and Mobility [(ROAM)](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/) Lab and Professor Lerrel Pinto at the General-purpose Robotics and AI Lab [(GRAIL)](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/), where I serve as a research assistant. Additionally, I'm a member of the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/), guided by Professor Hod Lipson, contributing to advancements at the intersection of robotics and AI.

### AnySkin: Plug-and-play Skin Sensing for Robotic Touch

While tactile sensing is widely accepted as an important and useful sensing modality, its use pales in comparison to other sensory modalities like vision and proprioception. AnySkin addresses the critical challenges that impede the use of tactile sensing -- versatility, replaceability, and data reusability.
