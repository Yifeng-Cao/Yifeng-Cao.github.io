I am a Master's student in Electronic Engineering at Columbia University, focusing on robotics, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. I have had the privilege of being advised by Professor Matei Ciocarlie at the Robotic Manipulation and Mobility (ROAM) Lab and Professor Lerrel Pinto at the General-purpose Robotics and AI Lab (GRAIL), where I serve as a research assistant. Additionally, I'm a member of the Creative Machines Lab, guided by Professor Hod Lipson, contributing to advancements at the intersection of robotics and AI.
