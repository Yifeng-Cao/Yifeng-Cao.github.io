I am a Master's student in Electronic Engineering at Columbia University, focusing on robotics, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. I have the privilege of being advised by Professor Matei Ciocarlie at the [Robotic Manipulation and Mobility (ROAM) Lab](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/) and by Professor [Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/) at the General-purpose Robotics and AI Lab (GRAIL), where I am a research assistant.
