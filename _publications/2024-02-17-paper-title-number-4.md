title: "Uncertainty Comes for Free: Human-in-the-Loop Policies with Diffusion Models"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'We leverage the generative process of diffusion policies to compute an uncertainty-based metric based on which the autonomous agent can decide to request operator assistance at deployment time, without requiring any operator interaction during training. Additionally, we show that the same method can be used for efficient data collection for fine-tuning diffusion policies in order to improve their autonomous performance.'
